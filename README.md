# address-assignment

An assignment assigned to be completed at my address.. You could call it '*homework*'

## Usage

FIXME

## Assumptions
For testing purposes I created sample data using [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/).
In the context of this assignment, the assumption has been made that tabs are equivalent
to spaces since spaces are not offered as a delimiter option on Mockaroo.
