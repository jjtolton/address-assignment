# address-assignment

An assignment assigned to be completed at my address.. You could call it '*homework*'

## Usage

FIX

## Assumptions
For testing purposes I created sample data using [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/).
In the context of this assignment, the assumption has been made that tabs are equivalent
to spaces since spaces are not offered as a delimiter option on Mockaroo.

*Note regarding spec* **Data that included superfluous whitespace (such as: "Linda Van Bullwinkle") has been deleted
for testing purposes. I am operating on the assumption that the data going in is clean, uniform data.**
